- updated SPEC file to include dependancies, clean up code (fixes provided by jcpearson)

- Do not show pad menu when a tablet does not have buttons (fix suggested by jcpearson)
- Per tablet configs (request from jcpearson)

- tweaked layout of stylus/eraser config to be more visually consistant
- tweaked layout of pad config to be more visually consistant
- added warning on exit notifying saving of config will occur
- Fixed: eraser pressure curve was being saved and would be set correctly but it was not reflected in the GUI on reload
- Added: ground work for detecting multiple tablets at once; configuring still requires one device at a time but can load configs for all connected devices
- Known Issue: You can not connect 2 devices of the same type, will not load configs correctly
- Known Issue: On exit throws exit code 139; config is saved correctly but something isn't terminating correctly... need to track down
* Wed May 16 2018 Travis Best <tb2097> - 0.1.11-1

- Added check if touch is available before trying to reset it (doesn't break but presents error in shell)

- broke writing the config file... that was stupid of me
* Mon Oct 23 2017 Travis Best <tb2097> - 0.1.8-1
- broke touch for older tablets
- newer libwacom reports tablets with a different name; ensured tablet name reported correctly
* Fri Oct 20 2017 Travis Best <tb2097> - 0.1.7-1
- Added: PTH-660
- Added: pad button reset
- Added: restore defaults button to options page
- Fixed: PTH-660 for some reason inverts to negative value for pressure at 50% (0.5->-0.5); put in logic to check for this.  Only seems to effect the testing area
